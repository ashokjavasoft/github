/*	java LinkedList class uses doubly linked list to store the elements. It provides a linked-list data structure. It inherits the AbstractList class and implements List and Deque interfaces.

	The important points about Java LinkedList are:

	Java LinkedList class can contain duplicate elements.
	Java LinkedList class maintains insertion order.
	Java LinkedList class is non synchronized.
	In Java LinkedList class, manipulation is fast because no shifting needs to be occurred.
	Java LinkedList class can be used as list, stack or queue.
	Hierarchy of LinkedList class
	As shown in above diagram, Java LinkedList class extends AbstractSequentialList class and implements List and Deque interfaces.

	Doubly Linked List
	In case of doubly linked list, we can add or remove elements from both side.

	java LinkedList class using doubly linked list
	LinkedList class declaration
	Let's see the declaration for java.util.LinkedList class.

	public class LinkedList<E> extends AbstractSequentialList<E> implements List<E>, Deque<E>, Cloneable, Serializable  
	Constructors of Java LinkedList
	Constructor	Description:
	------------------------
	LinkedList()	It is used to construct an empty list.
	LinkedList(Collection c)	It is used to construct a list containing the elements of the specified collection, in the order they are returned by the collection's iterator.
	Methods of Java LinkedList
	
	Method	Description:
	--------------------
	void      add(int index, Object element)	It is used to insert the specified element at the specified position index in a list.
	void     addFirst(Object o)	It is used to insert the given element at the beginning of a list.
	void     addLast(Object o)	It is used to append the given element to the end of a list.
	int      size()	It is used to return the number of elements in a list
	boolean  add(Object o)	It is used to append the specified element to the end of a list.
	boolean  contains(Object o)	It is used to return true if the list contains a specified element.
	boolean  remove(Object o)	It is used to remove the first occurence of the specified element in a list.
	Object   getFirst()	It is used to return the first element in a list.
	Object   getLast()	It is used to return the last element in a list.
	int      indexOf(Object o)	It is used to return the index in a list of the first occurrence of the specified element, or -1 if the list does not contain any element.
	int      lastIndexOf(Object o)	It is used to return the index in a list of the last occurrence of the specified element, or -1 if the list does not contain any element.
